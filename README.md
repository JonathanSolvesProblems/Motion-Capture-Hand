# Motion Capture Hand

1. Adafruit Unified Sensor
2. Adafruit BNO055
3. Blender
4. The motion capture hand made for this project.

# Steps
1. Plug in Arduino with everything connected.
2. Open the global arduino file and upload the code.
3. Open blender and navigate to the scripting window
4. run the imuDataManipulator.py and operator_hand.py with alt-p within the blender environment.
5. Navigate to the layout window and press f3 (or fn f3 on certain laptops) and search for Activate Hand
6. Press enter and everything will start to run


# Note
It takes around 3 seconds for the bones to orient itself properly upon running the script.

For more details on the project, feel free to read the report.pdf document.
